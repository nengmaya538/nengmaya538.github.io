<p>Building and maintaining a static site manually can be time-consuming, especially when frequent updates are required. That’s why developers like <b>ayushiiiiii thakur</b> often look for ways to <b>automate Jekyll builds and deployments</b> using <a href="https://zestlinkrun.my.id">GitHub Pages</a> and <b>GitHub Actions</b>. This guide will help you set up a reliable automation pipeline that compiles, tests, and publishes your Jekyll site automatically whenever you push changes to your repository.</p>

<h2>Why Automating Your Jekyll Build Process Matters</h2>

<p>Automation saves time, minimizes human error, and ensures consistent builds. With GitHub Actions, you can define a workflow that triggers on every push, pull request, or schedule — transforming your static site into a fully managed CI/CD system.</p>

<p>Whether you’re publishing a <a href="https://boostloopcraft.my.id">documentation hub</a>, a <a href="https://boostscopenest.my.id">personal portfolio</a>, or a <a href="https://castminthive.my.id">technical blog</a>, automation ensures your site stays updated and live with minimal effort.</p>

<h2>Understanding How GitHub Actions Works with Jekyll</h2>

<p><b>GitHub Actions</b> is an integrated CI/CD system built directly into GitHub. It lets you define custom workflows through YAML files placed in the <code>.github/workflows</code> directory. These workflows can run commands like building your Jekyll site, testing it, and deploying the output automatically to the <b>gh-pages</b> branch or the root branch of your GitHub Pages repository.</p>

<p>Here’s a high-level overview of how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Detect changes when you push commits to your main branch.</li>
  <li>Set up the Jekyll build environment.</li>
  <li>Install Ruby, Bundler, and your site dependencies.</li>
  <li>Run <code>jekyll build</code> to generate the static site.</li>
  <li>Deploy the contents of the <code>_site</code> folder automatically to GitHub Pages.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating a Basic GitHub Actions Workflow for Jekyll</h2>

<p>To start, create a new file named <code>deploy.yml</code> in your repository’s <code>.github/workflows</code> directory. Then paste the following configuration:</p>

<pre><code>name: Build and Deploy Jekyll Site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 3.1
          bundler-cache: true

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bundle install

      - name: Build Jekyll site
        run: bundle exec jekyll build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./_site
</code></pre>

<p>This workflow triggers every time you push changes to the main branch. It builds your site and automatically deploys the generated content from the <code>_site</code> directory to the GitHub Pages branch.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Secrets and Permissions</h2>

<p>GitHub Actions requires authentication to deploy files to your repository. Fortunately, you can use the built-in <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> secret, which GitHub provides automatically for each workflow run. This token has sufficient permission to push changes back to the same repository.</p>

<p>If you’re deploying to a custom domain like <a href="https://cherdira.my.id">cherdira.my.id</a> or <a href="https://cileubak.my.id">cileubak.my.id</a>, make sure your <code>CNAME</code> file is included in the <code>_site</code> directory before deployment so it’s not overwritten.</p>

<h2>Using Custom Plugins and Advanced Workflows</h2>

<p>One advantage of using GitHub Actions is that you can include plugins not supported by native GitHub Pages builds. Since the workflow runs locally on a virtual machine, it can build your site with any plugin as long as it’s included in your <code>Gemfile</code>.</p>

<p>Example extended workflow with unsupported plugins:</p>

<pre><code>      - name: Build with custom plugins
        run: |
          bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config.production.yml
</code></pre>

<p>This method is particularly useful for developers like <b>ayushiiiiii thakur</b> who use custom plugins for <a href="https://digtaghive.my.id">data visualization or dynamic layouts</a> that aren’t whitelisted by GitHub Pages.</p>

<h2>Scheduling Automated Rebuilds</h2>

<p>Sometimes, your Jekyll site includes data that changes over time, like API content or JSON feeds. You can schedule your site to rebuild automatically using the <b>schedule</b> event in GitHub Actions.</p>

<pre><code>on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 3 * * *" # Rebuild every day at 3 AM UTC
</code></pre>

<p>This ensures your site remains up to date without manual intervention. It’s particularly handy for news aggregators or portfolio sites that pull from external sources like <a href="https://driftclickbuzz.my.id">driftclickbuzz.my.id</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing Builds Before Deployment</h2>

<p>It’s a good idea to include a testing step before deployment to catch build errors early. Add a validation job to ensure your Jekyll configuration is correct:</p>

<pre><code>      - name: Validate build
        run: bundle exec jekyll doctor
</code></pre>

<p>This step helps detect common configuration issues, missing dependencies, or YAML syntax errors before publishing the final build.</p>

<h2>Example Workflow Summary Table</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Step</th>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Checkout</td>
      <td>actions/checkout@v3</td>
      <td>Fetch latest code from the repository</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Setup Ruby</td>
      <td>ruby/setup-ruby@v1</td>
      <td>Install the Ruby environment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Build Jekyll</td>
      <td>bundle exec jekyll build</td>
      <td>Generate the static site</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Deploy</td>
      <td>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3</td>
      <td>Publish site to GitHub Pages</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Common Problems and How to Fix Them</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Build fails with “No Jekyll site found”</b> — Check that your <code>_config.yml</code> and Gemfile exist at the repository root.</li>
  <li><b>Permission errors during deployment</b> — Ensure <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> permissions include write access to repository contents.</li>
  <li><b>Custom domain missing after deployment</b> — Add a <code>CNAME</code> file manually inside your <code>_site</code> folder before pushing.</li>
  <li><b>Action doesn’t trigger</b> — Verify that your branch name matches the workflow trigger condition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Reliable Automation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use pinned versions for Ruby and Jekyll to avoid compatibility surprises.</li>
  <li>Keep workflow files simple — fewer steps mean fewer potential failures.</li>
  <li>Include a validation step to detect configuration or dependency issues early.</li>
  <li>Document your workflow setup for collaborators like <b>ayushiiiiii thakur</b> to maintain consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>Automating Jekyll builds with GitHub Actions transforms your site into a fully managed pipeline. Once configured, your repository will rebuild and redeploy automatically whenever you commit updates. This not only saves time but ensures consistency and reliability for every release.</p>

<p>By leveraging the flexibility of Actions, developers can integrate plugins, validate builds, and schedule periodic updates seamlessly.
