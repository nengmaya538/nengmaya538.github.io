<h2 id="why-github-pages-is-perfect-for-bloggers">Why GitHub Pages Is Perfect for Bloggers</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the technical setup, it’s important to understand why GitHub Pages is such a popular option for bloggers. The platform offers <strong>free, secure, and fast hosting</strong> without the need to deal with complex server settings. Whether you’re a developer, writer, or designer, GitHub Pages provides a reliable environment to publish your ideas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it uses Git — a version control system — which lets you manage your blog’s history, collaborate with others, and revert changes easily. Combined with Jekyll, GitHub Pages allows you to write posts in Markdown and automatically converts them into clean, responsive HTML pages.</p>

<h3>Key Advantages for New Bloggers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No hosting or renewal fees.</li>
  <li>Built-in HTTPS security and fast CDN delivery.</li>
  <li>Integration with Jekyll for effortless blogging.</li>
  <li>Direct control over your content through Git.</li>
  <li>SEO-friendly structure for better Google ranking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating-your-github-account-and-repository">Creating Your GitHub Account and Repository</h2>
<p>The first step is to sign up for a free GitHub account. If you already have one, you can skip this part. Go to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>, click on “Sign Up,” and follow the on-screen instructions. Once your account is active, it’s time to create a new repository where your blog’s files will live.</p>

<h3>Steps to Create a Repository</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Log into your GitHub account.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>“+”</strong> icon at the top right and select <strong>“New repository.”</strong></li>
  <li>Name the repository as <code>yourusername.github.io</code> — this format is crucial for GitHub Pages to recognize it as a website.</li>
  <li>Set the repository visibility to “Public.”</li>
  <li>Click <strong>“Create repository.”</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve just created the foundation of your blog. The next step is to add content and structure to it.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-jekyll-for-your-blog">Setting Up Jekyll for Your Blog</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages natively supports <strong>Jekyll</strong>, a static site generator that simplifies blogging by allowing you to write posts in Markdown files. You don’t need to install anything locally to get started, but advanced users can install Jekyll on their computer for more control.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Using GitHub’s Built-In Jekyll Support</h3>
<p>Inside your new repository, create a file called <code>index.md</code> or <code>index.html</code>. You can start simple:</p>

<pre><code>
# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post powered by GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
</code></pre>

<p>Commit and push this file to the main branch. Within a minute or two, your blog should go live at:</p>
<p><strong>https://yourusername.github.io</strong></p>

<h3>Option 2: Setting Up Jekyll Locally</h3>
<p>If you prefer building locally, install Ruby and Jekyll on your machine:</p>

<pre><code>
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll new myblog
cd myblog
bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre>

<p>This lets you preview your blog at <code>http://localhost:4000</code> before pushing it to GitHub. Once satisfied, upload the contents to your repository’s main branch.</p>

<h2 id="customizing-your-theme-and-layout">Customizing Your Theme and Layout</h2>
<p>Jekyll offers dozens of free themes that you can use to personalize your blog. You can browse them on <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io">jekyllthemes.io</a> or use one from GitHub’s theme marketplace.</p>

<h3>How to Apply a Theme</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open the <code>_config.yml</code> file in your repository.</li>
  <li>Add or modify the following line:
  <pre><code>theme: minima</code></pre></li>
  <li>Commit and push the change.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Minima</strong> theme is the default Jekyll theme and a great starting point for beginners. You can later modify its layout, typography, or colors through custom CSS.</p>

<h3>Adding Navigation and Pages</h3>
<p>To make your blog more organized, you can add navigation links to pages like “About” or “Contact.” Simply create Markdown files such as <code>about.md</code> or <code>contact.md</code> and include them in your navigation bar.</p>

<h2 id="adding-your-first-post">Adding Your First Post</h2>
<p>Every Jekyll blog stores posts in a folder called <code>_posts</code>. To add your first article, create a new file following this format:</p>

<pre><code>_posts/2025-11-01-my-first-post.md</code></pre>

<p>Then, include the following front matter and content:</p>

<pre><code>
---
layout: post
title: "My First Blog Post"
categories: [personal,learning]
tags: [introduction,github-pages]
---
Welcome to my first post on GitHub Pages! I’m excited to share what I’ve learned so far.
</code></pre>

<p>After committing this file, GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site and display the post at <code>https://yourusername.github.io/2025/11/01/my-first-post.html</code>.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-a-custom-domain">Connecting a Custom Domain</h2>
<p>While your free URL works perfectly, using a <strong>custom domain</strong> helps your blog look more professional. Here’s how to connect one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy a domain from a registrar such as Namecheap, Google Domains, or Cloudflare.</li>
  <li>In your GitHub repository, create a file named <code>CNAME</code> and add your custom domain (e.g., <code>myblog.com</code>).</li>
  <li>In your DNS settings, create a CNAME record that points <code>www</code> to <code>yourusername.github.io</code>.</li>
  <li>Wait for the DNS to propagate (usually 30–60 minutes).</li>
</ol>

<p>Once configured, GitHub will automatically generate an SSL certificate for your domain, keeping your blog secure under HTTPS.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-and-updating-your-blog">Maintaining and Updating Your Blog</h2>
<p>After launching, maintaining your blog is easy. You can edit, update, or delete posts directly from GitHub’s web interface or a local editor like Visual Studio Code. Every commit automatically updates your live site. If something breaks, you can restore any previous version with a single click.</p>

<h3>Pro Tips for Long-Term Maintenance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep your dependencies up to date in <code>Gemfile.lock</code>.</li>
  <li>Regularly check for broken links or outdated URLs.</li>
  <li>Use meaningful commit messages to track changes easily.</li>
  <li>Consider automating builds using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-checklist-before-publishing">Final Checklist Before Publishing</h2>
<p>Before you announce your new blog to the world, make sure these points are covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>✅ The repository name matches <code>yourusername.github.io</code>.</li>
  <li>✅ The branch is set to <strong>main</strong> in your GitHub Pages settings.</li>
  <li>✅ The <code>_config.yml</code> file contains your site title, URL, and theme.</li>
  <li>✅ You’ve added at least one post in the <code>_posts</code> folder.</li>
  <li>✅ Optional: Connected your custom domain for branding.</li>
</ul>
